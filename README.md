java_webserver
==============

obselete, exprimental, java webserver implementation in a bid to learn about HTTP server side.


my first java based webserver implementation created in 2009.

never really worked much was just a code created to understand how multithreading works in java.

no plans on continuing it.

in github just for historical reasons or if anyone wants to quickly peek and see how to get things done dirty fast.
